# Camera-Format-Comparison

Lenses project images onto a focal plane. A format is a unique pair of height and width dimensions for the medium that captures that image. Two formats will "see" two different images that are projected, since the smaller format will be exposed to less of the image than the larger format.

At a certain lens setting, the format will be able to see a certain view of the world in front of the lens. This is an "angle of view". The angle can be measured horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, but this calculator matches horizontal angles of view assuming that the longest edge of the format is running horizontally.

The format is measured along the X and Y axes, but the amount of space that is in focus (acceptably sharp) in front of the camera is measured along the Z axis. This space in focus is called the "depth of field" and it is determined by the lens, not the format. If lens A is half the focal length of lens B, it has double the depth of field, all else equal. To change the depth of field without changing the focal length or distance from the subject, the camera operator can change the size of the diaphram (aperture) within the lens.

This camera format comparison takes an input format, its lens settings, and an output format to match that field of view and depth of field to.
